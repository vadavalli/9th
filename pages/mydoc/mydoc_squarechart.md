## About Square Chart

Developed by me for personal use in 2002. SquareChart is an interactive horoscope software in the south Indian square chart style. It is interactive. Progression and transits can be super-imposed on natal chart and can be navigated easily.

It is was very useful in my study of Astrology, as I could not find any software that meets my requirements.

It is somewhat ametuer, but servers the purpose. It is intended to be a prototype and I hope to develop a professional version in future.

You can download it from here: [SquareChart-5-Jun-2022.zip](downloads/SquareChart-5-Jun-2022.zip). 

Please contact me [vadavalli_nm@yahoo.com](mailto: vadavalli_nm@yahoo) if you face any issues or have suggestions for adding more features.
