## About Square Chart

Developed by me for personal use in 2005. SquareChart is an interactive horoscope software in the south Indian square chart style. Progressions and transits can be super-imposed on natal chart and can be navigated easily with date movement.

It is was very useful in my study of Astrology, as I could not find any other software that met my requirements.

It is somewhat ametuerish at the moment, but serves the purpose. It is intended to be a prototype and I hope to develop a professional version in future.

You can download it from here: [SquareChart-7-Jun-2022.zip](downloads/SquareChart-7-Jun-2022.zip). 
Unzip the file into any folder. Double click on SquareChart.exe file. It should launch the horoscope software.

If you get a failure message saying that it cannot find JRE (Java), then download the software from this link, which includes Java: [SquareChart_JRE.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mt_m5ktDQisJp7tQMlXqJsGbxmcebFGH/view?usp=sharing).

Please contact me [vadavalli_nm@yahoo.com](mailto: vadavalli_nm@yahoo) if you face any issues or have suggestions for adding more features.
