## About Square Chart

Developed by me for personal use in 2005. SquareChart is an interactive horoscope software in the south Indian square chart style. Progression and transits can be super-imposed on natal chart and can be navigated easily with the date movement.

It is was very useful in my study of Astrology, as I could not find any other software that met my requirements.

It is somewhat ametuer at the moment, but serves the purpose. It is intended to be a prototype and I hope to develop a professional version in future.

You can download it from here: [SquareChart-5-Jun-2022.zip](downloads/SquareChart-5-Jun-2022.zip). 

Please contact me [vadavalli_nm@yahoo.com](mailto: vadavalli_nm@yahoo) if you face any issues or have suggestions for adding more features.
