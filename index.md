## About me

{% include image.html file="Murali-Vadavalli.jpg" alt="Murali" caption="Murali Vadavalli" %}

Born in 1976. Been a software developer for more than 2 decades. My parents were disciples of [Master E.K](https://worldteachertrust.org/en/web/master/ek){:target="_blank"} and lived a life of devotion and spiritulity. I was very deeply inspired by Master E.K's writings at a very young age. Studied [Rosicrucian Philosophy](https://rosicrucian.com/index.html){:target="_blank"} and Theosophy in my teens. Developed an intense interest in Astrology at age 15 and I have been pursuing it since then.

The pursuit of Astrology led me into many things. At the age of 25, I started reading on Western Philosophy and on the topics of Consciousness, Cognitive Psychology and Evolutionary Psychology. I loved the scientific method, but realized that it leads to materialism (*all is matter, no soul; brain is a computer and mind is the software*).

I was torn between the materialism of Science, which is concrete and logical, and Spiritulity, which promises great meaning, but is logically vague. In recent years I discovered Vedanta and my inner conflict is mostly resolved. One of the basic teachings of Vedanta that appealed to me is this: *the degree of freedom and the quality of our life we experience is deteremined by the attitude with which we engage with the world*. If we learn to adopt an attitude of *Moksha* (un-attached devotion and love), it leads to an experience of *Moksha* - which is liberation. Science is essentially a study of the material world and it has no conflict with how we choose to live and experience life.

I have studied Astrology for 30 years and developed a few insights, which I want to share. I have recently started teaching Astrology and this webiste is for sharing some material for the students. There is very little content at the moment, but I will keep adding in the coming months.
